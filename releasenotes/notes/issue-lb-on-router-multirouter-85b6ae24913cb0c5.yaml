    With NSXV plugin, deleting a router interface of a tenant subnet, which has
    multiple routers attached, with use_routers_as_lbaas_platform enabled, in
    the configuration may result with an error.
issues:
  - |
    The configuration flag use_routers_as_lbaas_platform enables reuse NSXV
    edge appliances which are allocated to routers, for load balancing.
    When this flag is enabled, and a loadbalancer is created on a tenant
    network which has multiple attached routers, an error may occur while
    deleting a router interface on the subnet. This could happen even though
    the loadbalancer is hosted on a different router than the one which is used
    by the loadbalancer.
    To work around this, the loadbalancer should be removed prior to the
    deletion of the router interface.
